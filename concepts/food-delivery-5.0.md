This section picks up where the key findings in the section "[The Evolution of Delivery](../../findings/evolution/)" left off, if you haven’t read that yet, it can provide additional context for the starting point for the next phase.

We’ve seen that the domain has evolved rapidly over time and even more so in the last two decades. The widespread use of the internet, followed by the rapid adoption of smartphones has meant an increasing reliance on the convenience of having delivery platforms at your fingertips. With these platforms evolving rapidly themselves, with Deliveroo’s Editions being the latest, it’s only natural to wonder what’s next. The [VP of Strategic Projects at Deliveroo believes](https://www.indexventures.com/index-insight/behind-the-scenes-with-deliveroo){: target="_blank"} "The next round of growth will come from solving the problems that we haven’t yet solved for our customers, not just new opportunities" and has been informing investors the same over the past year. The investors were seemingly convinced by a vision based on this fact, because [Deliveroo raised $385 million](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/24/deliveroo-raises-385m/){: target="_blank"} in their last funding round and are valued at over $2 billion.

However, after looking at trends both in the food delivery industry as well as technology and the world in general, we have a few thought provoking questions and directions of our own, around where this domain would go to next.

#### What if data helped optimize and automate cooking for delivery?

Deliveroo is currently in the process of [rolling out the Deliveroo Toolkit](https://news.deliveroo.co.uk/news/new-technology-will-help-uk-restaurants-produce-more-meals.html){: target="_blank"} - an app that "will help restaurants organise and optimise kitchen operations to streamline food preparation, which will benefit their revenue streams, speed up orders for customers and enable riders to deliver more orders". To optimize cooking speed, the app breaks down prep time for chefs by item and even uses machine learning to predict order numbers to pre-emptively suggest the quantities to prep for. The app provides a real time overview of the kitchen operations to help chefs and restaurant managers identify bottlenecks while also helping standardize ingredient use and in turn improving purchasing efficiency for customers.

#### What if quantifying your appetite could reduce food waste?

Both[ Deliveroo in Dubai](https://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Article/2018/03/01/Deliveroo-looks-to-reduce-plastics-in-takeaway-packaging){: target="_blank"} and [Foodpanda in Singapore](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/foodpanda-customers-can-say-no-disposable-forks-and-spoons-next-month){: target="_blank"}, conducted experiments to allow users to opt-in for disposable cutlery and tableware. It was a roaring success, with the Dubai experiment showing that in most cases, there was a more than 50% reduction in the use of disposable cutlery. Both organizations now intend expand this to other locations.

If a simple checkbox of asking consumers whether or not they want disposable cutlery could have this kind of impact, what would happen if users were asked to quantify their current appetite so that chefs would adjust the quantity of food (and possibly the cost) accordingly?

#### What if delivery was no longer done by people?

[Deliveroo recently pitched to investors](https://london.eater.com/2018/3/29/17175482/deliveroo-future-plans-robots-profits-investors){: target="_blank"}, its plans to double margins by adopting AI and autonomous delivery robots. Starship technologies has already [tested robots for delivery in partnership with Just Eat](https://venturebeat.com/2016/07/05/just-eat-and-starship-technologies-to-power-food-delivery-in-london-with-self-driving-robots/){: target="_blank"} as well as [Dominos Pizza](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/dominos-and-starship-technologies-will-deliver-pizza-by-robot-in-europe-this-summer/){: target="_blank"} and have plans to launch [autonomous delivery on college campuses](https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/30/starship-technologies-launches-autonomous-robot-delivery-services-for-campuses/){: target="_blank"} in the US by the end of 2018

> In a robot delivered future, how does packaging change? 

How does packaging need to evolve in a situation where the consumer has to extract the food packaging themselves from the autonomous vehicle?

#### What if your dine in restaurant food was from Deliveroo?

We’ve previously seen a lot about Deliveroo Editions and how much the service is growing and expanding worldwide. Curiously, in November 2017, in their Katong Editions space in Singapore, [Deliveroo applied for a dine-in permit](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/deliveroo-may-soon-operate-a-dine-in-restaurant){: target="_blank"}. While this was rejected, April 2018, saw the launch of their [first dine-in space for Editions](https://vulcanpost.com/638667/second-deliveroo-editions-singapore/){: target="_blank"}.

With a range of high quality food offerings, including Michelin Star connected kitchens, this is a food court which is a class above. However, what if this were taken a step further? What if your dine in experience featured waiters who were actually food delivery agents?

Imagine all the hallmarks of an enjoyable dining out experience, reserve a table with friends, order a few drinks - but when it is time to order your food, instead of a traditional menu, you’re ordering from your Deliveroo or Foodora app to have amazing variety of food at your fingertips.

#### What if restaurants never had to order packaging again?

In a world that’s rapidly heading towards extensive Internet of Things (IoT) with estimates suggesting a [12x growth in the IoT Space in the next 5 years](https://hackernoon.com/internet-of-everything-the-iot-market-is-projected-to-expand-12x-from-2017-2023-175f845c2bcf){: target="_blank"} - it is soon going to be a question of simply having the right data to enable accurate analysis and forecasting.

<div class="text-center" markdown="1">
![](../../assets/pictures/concepts/packaging.png){: .image--max }
</div>

As a packaging manufacturer or wholesaler, imagine if you had real time information about the number of packages being used at a customer’s delivery operation based on the orders being placed. With this information, you’d know the current stock level and with sufficient information about trends in food orders, you’d also know how many orders are expected in the near future and how soon the customer is likely to run out. 

What if you looked at the next phase in vendor managed inventory and could anticipate this remotely and ship a new batch to the customer before this happened? 

What if this were simplified for the customers in a way that they didn’t have to ever worry about ordering for packaging supplies? 

> What if customers simply paid an easy, recurring, subscription fee?

#### What if delivery food and packaging had to be designed for an experience?

Our conference visits combined with our restaurant tours both confirmed this growing trend - food and food experiences that are designed to look and feel good and be shared extensively on social media networks like Instagram. However why should this be restricted to food in the dining in experience alone?

![](../../assets/pictures/concepts/Instagram.png){: .image--max }

Our [consumer research](../../findings/consumer/) revealed that one of the factors for delivery food that just missed out on our top 5 was the look and feel of the delivered experience. With the rise in Instagrammable food, why can’t share worthiness extend to delivery experiences as well? How can you design packaging to match the vision for the consumer experience envisioned by a chef?

> Can packaging be designed to enhance the visual experience of delivered food?

Why stop at just the visual experience? We’ve seen how Wagamama used a custom designed packaging solution to allow their takeaway containers to mimic their restaurant dining experience. Our conferences and study tour both indicated a growing demand for ethnic food experiences.

> What if delivery packaging needed to reflect the ethnic elements of the food as well?
