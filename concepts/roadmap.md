After gaining the insight of the ecosystem, we understood that if Huhtamaki wants to enter the domain, they would need to do more than only design and manufacture packaging. As the needs and problems of different stakeholders are different from each other, different kinds of actions need to be taken in order to fulfil them and to successfully enter this market. We ideated through a variety of iterations, starting with purely packaging and then going beyond as well.

We believe any successful solution needs to consider more than just the packaging, and with that in mind, we presented the idea for a five step roadmap of solutions that taps into gaps in the market and future trends. The roadmap is circular instead of linear as we see it should be a process, not a single project. The phases of the roadmap are: Ideal Packaging, Bike Specific Packaging, Intelligent Packaging, Customised Packaging in Small Quantities and Delivery Provider / Restaurant Partnership. These phases are intertwined and overlapping.

### Ideal Packaging

![](../../assets/pictures/concepts/2_final_render_packaging_flat.jpg){: .image--max }

As Ideal packaging we suggest a modular packaging concept in which the fibre moulding manufacturing technique already utilised by Huhtamaki is leveraged. The recycled moulded fibre packaging matches all the consumer needs that we have identified so far as it has

* the required level of rigidity which allows it to survive the delivery process
* good insulation properties which helps in temperature retention
* the advantage of being made of recycled material and thus is eco-friendly. 

Interestingly, as we were exploring our solution further and trying to find a good way to visualize the advantages of moulded fiber based packaging, we found that Huhtamaki is already offering a similar packaging via the Brio bowls and we believe these bowls are just the start and the concept can be taken even further.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="brio"></div>

We originally explored the possibility of having a tight fitting lid with clear plastic material to go with this packaging as we felt that this was an established standard, would help in identifying the food more easily (both for delivery agent and for consumer) and could be more appealing visually. However, after further discussions with the Huhtamaki team it was clear that this was a needless sacrifice of the eco-friendly advantages of the material choice especially since users knew what they were ordering and so the transparent lid might not be as much of an advantage. In addition, we know from our research that mixed materials in packaging hinder recycling efforts and so we finally went with a solution where the lids are also made of the same moulded fiber. For foods that might require ventilation, lids with ventilation holes can be produced.

One enhancement to the Brio concept is - **Modularity** - which is obviously a benefit in transportation as it stacks and slots to hold together with each other. It also minimises wasted space during transportation and allows the delivery agents to deliver more orders simultaneously. From the customers’ perspective, modularity brings benefits in the aspect that the packaging takes less space at the restaurants. Space is saved as well at home when the packaging is being recycled.

The other enhancement is how packaging can be held together with **an adhesive sleeve**, similar to the straps used at airports when checking in luggage. The sleeve is wrapped around the pile and it sticks to itself. Being tight, it helps the modular packaging stay together and ensures that the food gets less damaged when being delivered. The sleeve has a perforated handle, so it eliminates the need for plastic and paper bags. Additionally, the sleeve offers a big advantage to meet the delivery platform and the customer need for branding, as it would be easy to brand / customise for the clients at much lower costs than what it would to order bespoke branded packaging. The sleeve can be dispensed from a roll at the restaurants or it can be as pre cut individual sheets. The other advantage of this sleeve is the fact that it leverages another aspect of Huhtamaki’s expertise that we gleaned from our interaction with their India office - printing quality branding, especially onto sleeves.

### Bike Specific Packaging

To recap our findings from our research - after observing several delivery agents on bikes, both in the real world and during our exploration on YouTube - two things were apparent to us.

* In addition to the bumps that a rider experiences, there is a lot of horizontal movement when the delivery person is lifting it up or setting it down
* When worn by a delivery person, the bag is always at an incline while they’re riding the bike

So we couldn’t help but ask ourselves, why is it mandatory for the delivery agent to wear the backpack? Can’t there be a way to effectively mount it onto any bike?

During our ideation session, we had ideas around this possibility. We believe this would definitely bring more stability into the system and lead to less movement associated with the rider. The lack of a big backpack could also improve the mobility of the rider and in turn possibly enable faster delivery. However, the current trend is that delivery agents (or delivery platforms when they also act as delivery agents) offer employees to use their own bikes. This makes it easy to start working as a delivery person and ensures convenience of the trips. So maybe there could be a way that the delivery bag by default have a way of strapping onto the bike? This is a solution that could be explored further. 

The image below is an example of what exists right now and was observed in London, but this design currently loses the convenience of riders being able to use their own bikes and it also has less mobility. However there is definitely a higher guarantee for the stability of the food that’s delivered this way.

### Intelligent Packaging

The idea of intelligent packaging can be divided to packaging by subscription and using sensors in the packaging.

The **subscription model** is a new take on the vendor managed inventory model and would initially be based on the restaurant’s order data. By correlating the number of orders being placed with the number of pieces of packaging being used, it is possible to keep track of the packaging stock. Every time the restaurant’s packaging stock goes below a certain limit, a new batch of packaging can automatically be sent to the customer. This allows customers to operate more efficiently and minimise how much packaging needs to be stored. Over time, with machine learning, the system would also be able to predict order amounts and instead of being a system that reacts to low stock numbers, it can proactively ship based on a forecast of orders, thus ensuring greater efficiency. From the customer’s perspective, it reduces a lot of hassle that would normally go into figuring out order placement each time stocks run low and figuring out where to store the packaging as well. It is important to note that implementing this idea requires setting up partnering with delivery platforms and so getting access to their data about the orders and packaging being used.

We’ve seen the way Deliveroo use their extensive consumer data as a tool for rapid growth, whether it is their expansion into selling packaging or their Editions concept. **Sensors in the packaging** can directly help Deliveroo with their data collection ability and help enhance their service offering even further. Imagine having a temperature, humidity and vibration sensor in the secondary packaging - this could be used by Deliveroo to understand how much the food moves during transit and how well the temperature is retained and whether there’s a build up of moisture. This seems basic, but by combining the data of these factors over time, they could start optimizing routes for their delivery agents to ensure there’s less bumps and shorter time so that food arrives at the consumer’s location in the optimum condition. 

For practicalities of how the unit would be powered and how data would be transmitted, the unit could be powered by a small battery combined with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter. Since every delivery agent will carry a smartphone to manage their orders and delivery navigation, the same device can act as the conduit to transmit the data back to Deliveroo. In addition, since these sensors would be in the secondary packaging, the delivery agent always brings it back and the base packaging itself wouldn’t need to be retooled to incorporate sensors.

The other advantage of these sensors is how it can be used to improve the consumer experience too. In addition to their real time monitoring of the delivery time, they could also be provided with monitoring of the food temperature. This temperature can come with a threshold that is defined by the chef as to what the optimum consumption experience is, and when the temperature drops below that, the consumer can maybe be sent a message with an apology and recommending that they reheat the food in the microwave for a short duration for an optimum experience.

Thinking further, there is a possibility of utilizing data from intelligent packaging as a way of reducing food waste. Over time, information about the needed portion size can also be calculated from known user data such as amount of leftovers from previous orders. This way, the portion can be optimized for a specific user without even bothering them.

### Customised Packaging in Small Quantities

Common problems with packaging amongst the customers, especially small ones, are: time, space and lack of knowledge. This means that it is only feasible for them to order packaging in smaller quantities that can fit in what little storage space that they have. This however is in conflict with the customers’ desire for the packaging to be customised / branded. Branding can not be afforded due to the large minimum order quantities and as a workaround, some customers use branded stickers or stamps to brand their packaging, but those are extra steps in the process. The space in restaurants is limited and that’s why some restaurants don’t even have a delivery option. These are some reasons that we proposed to sell a solution for customised packaging in small quantities. 

![](../../assets/pictures/concepts/1_final_render_packaging_stack.jpg){: .image--max }

The proposed sleeve concept  in the "Ideal packaging" section serves these customization needs perfectly. While packaging is produced by the manufacturing company (like Huhtamaki), the sleeves can be printed by Huhtamaki’s printing subsidiaries all over the world. The branding designs on these sleeves can be made with close collaboration with the restaurant so that they meet requirements and at the same time ensures that the restaurants are willing to use the packaging compatible with the sleeves. 

### Delivery Provider / Restaurant Partnership

In order to successfully execute the above mentioned steps, Huhtamaki should establish relationships with the delivery providers and the restaurants. In addition, we know from our insights that the aesthetics and the overall experience (especially ethnic ones) are important. 

To address this, we recommend that packaging should be designed in collaboration with the restaurants (and other stakeholders). In an ideal scenario, this partnership is taken to the point where packaging is designed simultaneously with the food in a way that they are perfectly compatible. This co-creation process between customers and packaging manufacturer can lead to packaging that’s aligned with the goals of the culinary experience that the chef wants to deliver. It can also ensure that delivery oriented menus are created that keep the lim   itations of packaging in mind or even better, embrace these limitations and adapt to it. 

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="design-with-food"></div>

Furthermore, we already know that customers might not know where to source packaging and they have no time to figure it out, so in many cases they order packaging from their existing wholesalers and end up paying a high price from the packaging they use. They might not have the knowledge of what is suitable packaging for their product, so consumers end up having bad consuming experiences. That is costly for restaurants and delivery platforms as they eventually need to compensate for the orders that have gone wrong.

### More Ideation 

While the ideas described above represent our selected direction for the overall solution, there were several other ideas that were not selected. Often, the selection was voted against as there are still some technical problems that go beyond our skill set as a student team to fix and put them into the real practice. However, we believe it is still worth to share them.

![](../../assets/pictures/concepts/ideation-3.jpg){: .image--max }	

One idea we thought about is to add a heating system to the secondary/tertiary package in which the food packaging is carried. The idea was to insert a powered and possibly rechargeable heating plate in the bottom of the secondary package. We considered situations where cars are still used by delivery agents (like for example Wolt does in Helsinki) and in those cases, this could be something that plugs into the vehicle’s cigarette lighter 12V socket too.

![](../../assets/pictures/concepts/ideation-4.jpg){: .image--max }	

This would combine with the temperature sensors discussed in the intelligent packaging section above to track the temperature inside the box in real time. As the temperature drops below a certain optimum consumption experience level as determined by the customer/chef, it could be set to trigger and control the heating plate on and off. This way we can remain the temperature inside the secondary package, to keep the best condition for the meal we are delivering. 

Another idea that we had was around having packaging with some kind of self stabilizing bottom, a bit like an internal gyroscope. Given how much time the packaging spends on an incline when the backpack is on the rider’s back, we considered the possibility that the backpack itself can be designed with floating bottom so that it responds the inclines and ensures that the packaging within it always stays parallel to the ground. This can be done if the bottom is based on some sort of liquid layer. However, we must admit that water seems too heavy liquid, especially when speaking about bike delivery. Also, the cost production of such packaging seems higher than expected. Nevertheless, with some technological investment, the idea should be working if implemented on secondary packaging and with specific material.
