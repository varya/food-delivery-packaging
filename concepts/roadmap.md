After gaining the insight of the ecosystem, we understood that if Huhtamaki wants to enter the domain, they would need to do more than only design and manufacture packaging. As the needs and problems of different stakeholders are different from each other, different kinds of actions need to be taken in order to fulfil them and to successfully enter this market. We ideated through a variety of iterations, starting with purely packaging and then going beyond as well.

## Design with food

Packaging that’s designed in collaboration with restaurants based on the dishes.

The food is part of the design process and thus the desired features of the food experience can be given to the packaging -eg.  instagram friendly or ethnic food experiences


## Customizing Packaging in Small Quantities

Instead of branding the boxes, create sleeves for the boxes that can help insulation and can be branded according to customer needs. This would be cheaper to produce than branding the packaging itself.


## Intelligent packaging

Sensors for temperature & humidity, either in the delivery bags or in the secondary packaging. These sensors are bluetooth enabled so they transmit data to the delivery agent’s phone via that, and from the phone the restaurant and consumer can track it.
