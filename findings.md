Our extensive consumer research proved to be extremely fruitful as it provided us with a clear picture of exactly what users needed. From our ethnographic research we were able to determine that there wasn’t much of a difference between mature markets like Finland and emerging markets like India in terms of packaging needs and user behavior. The only differences we observed were from a cultural perspective, particularly the

and regional differences in cuisines. The additional consumer research that we did helped create a prioritized list of what features mattered most to consumers when it came to packaging.

## Industry Findings

Our attendance of conferences revealed a clear insight into the perspectives of delivery platforms, customers and delivery agents. We found that the customer is the key deciding factor for packaging at the moment, but they could be persuaded to adapt if the consumer demand changed. We also found that consumers value the time it takes for delivery as the key deciding factor on what delivery service they use, rather than loyalty to any particular service.

Our secondary research revealed some key insights into the world’s largest delivery market in China while we were also able to find useful information on the secondary and tertiary packaging that’s in use. Lastly, our visits to Huhtamaki’s factory setup and the facilities of Sense n Insight helped round off a comprehensive understanding of the industry.

## Ecosystem

By integrating direct insights from consumers and combining that with key information gleaned from food delivery conferences, restaurant tours, interactions with representatives from delivery companies and even lots of video observations of the delivery process, we were able to craft a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem. The ecosystem diagram has been designed in such a way that, depending on the focus and specific businesses, we can represent this map with different layers of information as desired.

It’s important to note that while Deliveroo and Foodora are defined as Delivery Platforms, they are rapidly evolving in a manner that could redefine the space that they’re operating in. Both now offer their own curated packaging marketplaces, thus taking on the role of packaging wholesalers, to offer quality packaging to restaurants in smaller quantities. In addition, Deliveroo is looking to expand their influence even further by setting up consolidated, delivery focused kitchens in containers and this is only the beginning.

## Key Insights

Based on all our consumer and customer research, we were able to determine the key requirements from packaging from both their perspectives. The consumer takes priority here as the customer research revealed how customers would have to adapt to their demands.

1. Retain Heat/Cold
1. Leak Proof
1. Organized

In addition, our research overall revealed how the food delivery domain has evolved from the start to the modern day version of it. In particular, it was clear that the biggest movers in the space were the delivery platforms with the likes of

It’s these delivery companies who are increasing their influence by expanding into other areas of the domain as well.
