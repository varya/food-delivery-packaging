The food delivery ecosystem is huge. According to data from Statista, the market is currently valued at over 120 billion Euros and is growing at a rate of over 30% annually. Huhtamaki recognized the huge opportunity in this space but needed to understand it properly and then find a niche within which they could become a player in this space. This was the primary purpose.

## Huhtamaki’s Perspective

When we started off, we sought to understand Huhtamaki’s key values that could potentially act as an underlying principle for our own approach to the project, but also to see how it meshes with the needs of other players in the domain. The key values as mentioned by the team from Huhtamaki were

* Environmental performance is very important as it is an underlying value for the company and this is because customers value it as well.
* Food safety and food protection performance are defaults. The key dimensions for protection are chemical, physical and environmental
* Food waste and the prevention of it is another aspect to consider

Huhtamaki operated in a primarily product focused approach but were identifying areas in which they could do more. They also had a variety of strengths in various segments but still had untapped opportunities in combining these strengths and doing more. We sought to find ways to leverage what offerings and strengths Huhtamaki already had while providing a future focused solution.

The other aspect the we learned was how, until now, they have a good understanding of customers and this has built a great reputation as a packaging converter who executes on designs provided by customers. Going forward, Huhtamaki wants to increase their relevance and add value to the customers as well. In addition, they had never really done much work with the consumer needs in mind and this project was an opportunity to change that.

## Project Scope & Overall Plan

The first phase of the project was focused on understanding the ecosystem from the perspective of using this information and consumer insights to create a packaging concept that can disrupt this space. This understanding needed to answer the following questions

* What happens between the point of production and the point of consumption?
* Who are the players? What are the business relations between them?
* What is the distribution like?
* Who has the power? Who is the primary influencer in this space?

We were to consider the needs of mature markets like those in Europe and America but also contrast them with fast growing markets like those in Asia to see where the ideal path forward was. Over time, the scope evolved as the ecosystem proved to be a far richer source of insights into the domain and provided plenty of potential opportunities to dive into the space. After some evolution, our final scope involved using the detailed understanding of the ecosystem to identify new growth opportunities, not just in terms of packaging but in terms of business and service models as well.

Our overall project plan was as follows.
