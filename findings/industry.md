### Secondary Research

In several cases, our secondary research findings supported what we found from our deep dive into the consumer and customer needs as well. One example comes from our attempt to understand how the customer currently obtains their packaging for personal use and this led us to their quest for wholesalers and helped us understand how messy their process is to find packaging at all, leave alone good packaging. We particularly looked at the [Webstaurant Store](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/47255/disposable-take-out-containers.html){: target="_blank" } and were able to compare and contrast with emerging services like Foodora’s packaging store which is discussed in more detail in the discussion in the section on [The Evolution of Delivery](../../findings/evolution/).

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/Webstaurant-Store.png)

Another one of the key questions we wanted to explore was whether or not customers had ever looked to innovate on their own to create a better consumer experience via better packaging. Our research uncovered two widely acclaimed examples by the design agency, [Pearlfisher](http://www.pearlfisher.com/){: target="_blank" } - one a [modular takeaway solution for Zizzi](https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/13-19-november-2017/zizzi-reimagines-the-social-night-in-with-modular-takeaway-packaging/){: target="_blank" } and the other, a solution that replicated the on site experience with [takeout packaging for Wagamama](http://designawards.core77.com/Packaging/49540/Wagamama-Takeout-Experience){: target="_blank" }.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="better-packaging"></div>

Our secondary research also uncovered fascinating trends in the domain and this helped us immensely with our future focused solutions. We uncovered how data was being used to optimize the delivery process at [Deliveroo](https://news.deliveroo.co.uk/news/new-technology-will-help-uk-restaurants-produce-more-meals.html){: target="_blank" } and how companies are jumping on board the autonomous vehicle driven future with [Starship Tech launching robot delivery services](https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/30/starship-technologies-launches-autonomous-robot-delivery-services-for-campuses/){: target="_blank" } for college campuses. We also did a deep dive into trends related to other emerging technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and even did an Aalto course on the topic which eventually ended up being one of the key elements of our overall solution. You can find out more about how we leveraged our trends in [Food Delivery 5.0](../../concepts/food-delivery-5.0/) and can also read more about our concept and IoT plays a part in [Intelligent packaging](../../concepts/roadmap/) as well.

#### Food Delivery in China

According to the "[39th Statistic report on Internet Development in China](https://cnnic.com.cn/IDR/ReportDownloads/){: target="_blank" }" published by CNNIC (China Internet Network Information Center), January 22, 2017 - Until December 2016, the number of Chinese netizens already reached 731 million, equivalent to the total population in Europe, and more than 28.5% of Chinese netizens used Online food delivery service in their daily life. We know from the market numbers obtained via Statista, that the food delivery industry has a current revenue of [110 billion EUR](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/food-delivery/worldwide?currency=eur){: target="_blank" } globally, but just in the Chinese market, the revenue has already exceeded [43.9 billion EUR](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/117/food-delivery/china?currency=eur#){: target="_blank" }. Compared to the North American market [23.8 billion EUR](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/104/food-delivery/north-america?currency=eur){: target="_blank" } and European market [25.6 billion EUR](https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/102/food-delivery/europe?currency=eur){: target="_blank" }, we can say China is currently the world’s largest market for food delivery. But because of China’s complicated policy structures, particularly for outsiders, and the existence of [two major players Meituan and Ele.me (include their new acquired food delivery company Baidu Waimai) already occupied 96.6% of the market](http://www.iimedia.cn/60449.html){: target="_blank" } - the Chinese market also becomes the most difficult market to penetrate. However, it was still imperative for us to study this market to understand what the trends were and what was being done here that could be relevant for the rest of the world.

Based on our research on the food delivery market in China, we found a few aspects that are worth learning from China’s food delivery service.

</div>

##### Wider Food Delivery Destination Range

The best example of this aspect will be the[ food delivery service on the train](http://www.sohu.com/a/160491814_413638){: target="_blank" }. China’s national railway company started a new service, that let’s a consumer order food delivery from their partner restaurants through the railway company’s website or app when you are on the train. You place the order 1 hour before the arrival at the designated station and after the restaurant receives the order, the meal will be delivered to that station's food delivery distribution center about 15 minutes before the train arrives. After being collected by the station staff, the meal will be delivered to the attendant on the train and once the train arrives it will be sent to the passenger who ordered the food. However, if the train is delayed more than 30 minutes, the reservation will be canceled and the fee will be refunded.

##### Increased Sense of Food Safety

In order to alleviate any concerns around food safety on a food delivery platform, Ele.me started a new service of [live streaming the kitchen of the restaurant](http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2017-12-20/doc-ifyptkyk5442902.shtml){: target="_blank" }. Customers can watch the live stream from their APP or website to inspect their chosen restaurant’s kitchen hygiene conditions and the food preparation process.

<div class="text-center" markdown="1">
![](../../assets/pictures/findings/kitchen-live-stream.jpg)
</div>

##### More Eco-Friendly Deliveries

In September 2017, Ele.me launched the "[Blue planet](http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2018-04-22/doc-ifznefkh8075416.shtml){: target="_blank" }" program in three phases in order to reduce the use of disposable tableware. The first phase, added a “no tableware needed” option in the app and created series of activities to lead customers to reduce the use of disposable tableware. In the second phase, using big data, they determined which restaurants were using a large amount of disposable tableware and helped them develop an environmental protection plan to reduce the use of disposable tableware. In the last phase, by using demand side’s progress to push forward the reform of the supply chain. And for Meituan, they also started their “[Green Hills](http://tech.qq.com/a/20170901/064856.htm){: target="_blank" }” plan in August 2017 by adding a “no tableware needed” option in the app, creating a Chief Environmental Officer position in the company, regularly hosting food delivery environmental protection conferences and lastly, designing a series of new eco-friendly food delivery packages to lead the company to a more sustainable direction.

##### Combine Big Data and AI.

Both for [Meituan](https://tech.meituan.com/herenqing_ai_con.html){: target="_blank" } and [Ele.me](http://lrd.ele.me/){: target="_blank" }, they adopted big data analytics and AI technology to improve their food delivery process. Their delivery service is based on their intelligent dispatching system and delivery algorithm. Meals will be distributed to the delivery person according to not just to the principle of proximity, but also considering the best routes, traffic factors and the delivery person’s delivery situation. With this new technology, food delivery companies guarantee that all the food orders can be delivered on time (30 min delivery or full refund). Besides, with the AI technology, delivery companies in China also started to[ test using autopilot smart cars and drones to deliver food](https://technews.cn/2017/09/25/ele/){: target="_blank" }. 

##### Expand Scope and Alibaba’s New Retail

The peak of food delivery is mainly concentrated on lunch and dinner. There is a large amount of idle delivery capacity during the rest of the time, [Ele.me effectively used the delivery person's idle time to meet the needs of other levels of logistics and distribution](https://fengniao.ele.me/){: target="_blank" }. In Ele.me’s delivery services, the categories are no longer limited to meals, but are increasingly diversified. From meals to fresh fruit, supermarkets, flowers, and other daily necessities, the types of products to be delivered is getting more varied. Besides, their delivery service starts to combine with cold chain logistics and other equipment to make their services be more diversified. Moreover, [Ele.me joined Alibaba](http://caijing.chinadaily.com.cn/2018-04/04/content_35974497.htm){: target="_blank" }’s [new retail layout](https://crs.tmall.com/intopic?spm=a2114k.8706244.0.0.DnHph0){: target="_blank" } and Meituan’s business strategy is also moving to the direction of "online + offline" - where the major food delivery platforms are getting more closely linked to offline retail. In 2017, chain supermarkets, department stores, and convenience stores all entered these delivery platforms. Physical retailers use these delivery platforms to expand their online channels. The new retail layout may further integrate resources and expand into the offline form to increase the current services category of the online food delivery platforms, and help them get more capital and resources support. 	Online food delivery platforms in China may become a key part in the new retail layout.

##### Case Study: Self Heating Hot Pot Packaging

When we were doing the industry research in the Chinese market, we found a one kind of food package, a self heating package for convenient hot pot in China. The concept was really interesting and we decided it was worth it to study and we believe it could bring some inspiration to our eventual ideation.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="hotpot-outlook"></div>

The self heating hot pot is packaged into a box as a meal kit and it could be cooked with just cold water. The box contains an inner tray that tightly matches it and contains various cooking ingredients sealed inside clear film sachets. Those include a vacuum-packed rice vermicelli noodles, a retort pouch of vegetables, a retort pouch of beef, a sachet of Ma La soup base, a sachet of sesame oil and a bag of hot spicy paprika powder dip. Under the tray, there is a water-activated heating pack, a sachet containing wooden chopsticks and napkins, and also an instruction of "how to use the self- heating hot pot" at the bottom of the box. A friction-fit lid with a venting aperture right in the center is used to close the box.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="hotpot-cooking"></div>

To cook the hot pot, just following the instructions that are given in the box. The key aspect is the step where you place the heating pack in the bottom of the box and pour a small amount of room temperature water over it. After that, put the tray back, close the box with the lid, and then wait 15 minutes for the exothermic reaction from the heating pack to heat the food.

In the traditional food packaging concept, the food package is just to use to protect food. But from this self heating package, we find packaging can actually can go much further than just the food protection. Since the only thing it needs for the reaction to cook the meal is water, it’s easy to use anywhere and can serve as a clever catering solution for outdoor sports, camping, traveling, or any sort of ’emergency’ food supply. Right as we encountered this, we realized there are interesting possibilities for the food delivery context as well.

#### Secondary & Tertiary Packaging

From the food packaging aspect, we also did some research on the secondary packaging, also known as the Insulation Chests. According to the different texture of the insulation chest, it can be divided into different types, including plastic, fabric, EPP material (Expanded polypropylene), EPS foam board (Polystyrene foam board), metal material, wood, XPS board. XPS board is the third generation of rigid foam insulation material and it overcomes the complicated production process of EPS board from the process, and has the superior performance that EPS board cannot replace. This material can have different pressure (150-500 Kpa) while having the same low value thermal conductivity (only 0.028W/MK) and enduring excellent thermal and compressive properties, compressive strength up to 220-500Kpa. Nowadays, in the Chinese market, XPS board is the most common insulation materials used in the Insulation Chests.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="ele-secondary"></div>

We did some search on the Chinese online marketplace and asked few manufacturers of this kind of insulation chests, trying to find out if there has a standard size for this insulation chests, but we found there actually have no standard size for that and manufacturers in China can make it as big as customers want. On average, the size of the insulation chests currently being used in the market is always around 175*120*55mm, more or less,  because it is the easiest size to put it on the bike, carried by delivery people and cross the doorway without any problem. 

#### Delivery Agents on Bikes

Another aspect of our secondary research involved the exploration of videos highlighting the experiences of delivery agents that we surprisingly found a great many of on Youtube. We found that the food, when placed in the backpack, goes through a far wider range of motion than we had originally expected. There are the usual bumps on the road that the delivery agents body acts as a natural shock absorber for but we hadn’t considered how much the bag itself moves when the agent is lifting it up to put it on and then removing it at the time of delivery.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="bike-delivery"></div>

If that’s not enough, one of the more important aspects that emerged was how, while the bike is being used, the packaging is always at an incline, which means by default, the food inside the packaging is likely to move around and if not properly packed or properly sealed, the chance of leaks is not insignificant. Some of the most important themes that emerged from this really helped define our overall solution at the end and you can read about that in our [Solution Roadmap](../../concepts/roadmap/).

### Conferences & Customer Research

As a part of the industry research we attended a delivery conference and a restaurant study tour both of them held in London. 

#### [Post & Parcel Food Delivery Seminar](http://www.postandparcel.live/events/post-parcel-live-2018-the-food-delivery-seminar/event-summary-c6c4c18eb04f4ae79827b074e5491772.aspx){: target="_blank" }, Jan 25th 2018

The speakers in the conference included delivery logistics partners, packaging manufacturers and delivery solutions providers. 

Speakers from:

* [Exaactly](https://exaactly.com)
* [Quiqup](https://www.quiqup.com)
* [Street Stream](https://streetstream.co.uk)
* [Stuart](https://stuart.com)

* [What3Words](https://what3words.com)

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/Companies-at-conference.png){: .image--max }

One common theme was that consumers lack loyalty to a delivery service even if there’s stickiness after sign up. They simply pick the service that can deliver what they want in a shorter time duration. 

> It is the delivery time that matters most to customers 

This need for a faster delivery time, especially in urban areas has led to the adoption of bikes for delivery at an increasing rate. In addition to faster delivery time, for delivery platforms like Deliveroo, maintaining the quality of service and thus retaining best delivery agents for peak delivery times (lunch/dinner) is vital for a positive consumer experience and because of this, they pay their delivery agents more. At Foodora, this issue has been avoided by adopting a model where the delivery agents are on their payroll. 

> Currently, customers hold the power for packaging solutions, but they will have to listen if consumers demand it.

#### [MCA Food-to-go](https://www.foodtogoconference.co.uk)[ Study Tour](https://www.foodtogoconference.co.uk){: target="_blank" }, Feb 8th 2018

The restaurant study tour consisted of 17 QSR restaurants in Victoria, Soho and Shoreditch areas in London. We were presented with current trends that shape the market. The trends were healthy eating, provenance, indulgence, informality, foodie culture and convenience. 

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/2nd-conf.jpg){: .image--max }

The lunch culture in London is characterised by take-away food shops that offer salads, sandwiches and other foods in boxes and cups. In general, delivery packaging is generic: cardboard and rigid plastic cups for liquid foods, flexible plastic and paper wrappings/bags for sandwiches and wraps, plastic & pulp trays, erectable boxes and paper bags to carry the products. 

Some restaurants used packaging for their internal logistics. In Crosstown donut shop for example, the products were delivered from the central kitchen to the retail units in corrugated cardboard boxes. The boxes were measured to fit their shelving units and delivery trolleys. It was common to get raw materials such as salads in flow packed bags. Also different kinds of boxes and trays were used in internal food logistics. Often pre cooked ingredients were delivered by big kitchens. There is also a demand in customised foods. 

Some restaurants had pre-order collection points. The collection points were often clearly indicated so the delivery agents find the pick up point easily. In Hop Vietnamese restaurant, the delivery collection point was very visibly marked right at the door. Staff at restaurant / cafe / market called Sourced Market said that they don’t offer deliveries as they lack the space for this activity. 

The actual deliveries were done both by delivery platforms’ agents as well as by the restaurants’ own staff.

### Delivery Platforms

Our interaction with people from Delivery Hero and Foodora proved to be extremely fruitful as the people we interviewed were a treasure trove of information. One had a lot of insights into topics related to packaging while being well balanced by the other who had a much more business and market dynamic oriented view. The insights helped us complete our understanding of the ecosystem, which you can read more about [here](../../findings/ecosystem/).

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/DeliveryHero.jpg){: .image--max }

The insights also helped validate some of our own findings from the consumer research such as the increasing demand from consumers to know whether a restaurant is eco-friendly. Some of these platforms are marking restaurants as "green" to assist consumers in identifying these more easily. We also got validation that they key differences in delivery patterns arise from culture specific and cuisine specific differences but the underlying demand for food to have food delivered fast and at a high quality was universal. Another interesting insight was the below quote, as it proved to be quite revealing about the direction in which delivery platforms are heading.

> "When you’re a global brand, you can try and control the process from A to Z and influence the market a bit more"

This quote was also accompanied by fascinating dynamics between the different players in the ecosystem. From the customer perspective, a lot of them have not really thought about proper packaging and don’t care about the consumer experience once the food has been handed over to the delivery agent. In these situations, the delivery platform becomes the primary communicator with the consumer, both for placing order but also for receiving complaints. As such, delivery companies have a well documented library of packaging related consumer complaints and are best placed to identify ways to solve these issues and also push customers to adopt these solutions. Even in situations where the customers were aware enough of consumer needs and wanted to improve packaging, they don’t know where to procure quality packaging that’s affordable even in smaller quantities. 

One of the ways that these companies are trying to solve this challenge is by setting up their own store to curate and sell quality delivery packaging in smaller quantities and reasonable prices. Steps like this are still an experiment but are changing the very ecosystem that we’ve been studying, and you can find out more about this in [The Evolution of Delivery section](../../findings/evolution/).

### Huhtamaki Capabilities and Production Facilities

The team visited Huhtamaki’s factory in Hämeenlinna to better understand the company’s production capabilities. Huhtamaki has three technological segments: packaging with polymer coating (e.g. cups), fibre packaging (e.g. egg packaging) and flexible packaging (e.g. pouches). Polymer coated packaging is a segment where Huhtamaki serves big players globally. In fibre packaging, Huhtamaki is the largest manufacturer in the world. Flexible multilayer packaging have great abilities to protect food. Huhtamaki’s advantage is that they are the only ones who have three different segments. 

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/factory.jpg){: .image--max }

We aimed to leverage the production capabilities of these segments in our final solution, although we agreed not to be limited in current materials or production, but look into the future. We got insights of the production volumes and minimum order qualities. The production only makes money while the machines are running. As they are massive and complex equipment, the downtime between runs is long and costly, hence the minimum order quantities are large. 

### Sense n Insight 

We spoke to experts about packaging at [Sense n Insight](http://senseninsight.com){: target="_blank" }, which is a merge of PTR (Package Testing and Research), Makery and Best Before. They showcased their suite of offerings and what they specialize in and allowed us to go hands on with some samples of innovative food packaging. They also presented us with their tool that measures packaging in three levels: packaging in store, the actual packaging and the product. The company conducts qualitative and quantitative research, eye tracking, packaging usability research, focus groups etc. We also took part in a demo eye tracking study that they use to evaluate the visibility, attractiveness and overall consumer preference for packaging design in stores.
