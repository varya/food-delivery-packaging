Our wide and varied [research methods](../../methodology), which included [secondary research](../..//methodology/secondary-research/), [conferences](../..//methodology/industry-research/), [ethnographic research](../../methodology/consumer-research/), interviews and even youtube videos, combine nicely with our co-creation process where Huhtamaki was involved in defining the insights that were key for them. This leads to a complete 360 degree view of perspectives based on which we can extract our most significant findings. These key insights are an amalgamation of [consumer findings](../..//findings/consumer/), [industry findings](../../findings/industry/) and in turn, our understanding of the [ecosystem](../../findings/ecosystem/) as well.

#### Customer Makes the Packaging Decisions in the Ecosystem

The most influential player in the ecosystem, at least from the perspective of making decisions around packaging, is the customer. Packaging wholesalers cater their operations towards addressing these customer needs and delivery platforms cater their entire suite of services to offer greater benefit to customers. From our consumer research, we also found that the choice of packaging, and thus the packaging quality, is not linked to the maturity of market, but purely the preference of the restaurant and how much they’re willing to pay. In addition, as we’ll see in the section about the food delivery domain, delivery platforms are trying to evolve towards capturing more of the value that customers currently hold in the ecosystem.

#### Consumers Want Faster Delivery for a Reason

For consumers, it was interesting that the most important aspect when ordering for delivery was delivery time and their biggest desire was faster deliveries. This desire was expressed to the extent where several were willing to pay extra if it guaranteed faster delivery. While food is certainly part of the base of [Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html){: target="_blank" }, and everyone will obviously be happy getting their food instantly, we believe the **desire for faster delivery stems from issues with packaging**. People don’t want food to arrive faster as much as they want it to arrive warm, fresh, without leaks and in a condition that’s not too different from what they’d find at a restaurant.

#### Packaging Issues are Mostly Universal

Consumers have similar issues with food delivery packaging around the world as their delivery preferences at an individual level are quite similar regardless of where they’re from or how old they are . The only differing delivery patterns across different regions of the world are tied to cultural differences like cuisine and being individualistic vs collective. The cuisine part however implies that a singular packaging design would not fit all needs, any solution would need to be a suite of offerings.

#### Food Waste Has Two Unexpected Causes

From our research, we discovered that there are several instances of food wastage and on digging deeper we discovered that this was mostly down to two key causes. **Non-standard portion sizes** mean that sometimes there’s often occasions where there’s too much food for a single meal, but not sufficient food to save the leftovers to consume later. Many customers have a **minimum order** before they will offer delivery and often, in order to meet this threshold amount, consumers end up ordering more food.

### Core Packaging Problem

The consumer findings section showed us the variety of packaging related issues that consumers face as well as the features that they desire.

The key features transcend multiple demands and a successful packaging solution will solve the core packaging problem by having these key features.

1. Retain Freshness
1. Retain Heat/Cold
1. Leak Proof
1. Organized
1. Eco Friendly

Based on all our consumer and customer research, we were able to determine the key requirements from packaging from their unique perspectives as well as that of the delivery platform. The consumer takes priority here as the customer research revealed how customers would have to adapt to their demands.

<hr/>

Given the vast variety of food types, one single packaging solution might not be the answer. The problem is likely to require a suite of solutions. In addition, packaging isn’t the only contributing factor to the delivery experience, there’s more factors at play and these need to be considered as well.
