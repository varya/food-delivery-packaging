In addition to our key insights, our research overall revealed how the food delivery domain has evolved from the its origins to the modern day version of it. While historically, the earliest evidence for services resembling food delivery is centuries old from the Ancient Roman Empire, in the modern era, the earliest form of delivery as we know is from when [pizza was delivered to Queen Margherita in Naples in 1889](https://www.refinery29.com/2017/04/149332/first-pizza-delivery-story){: target="_blank" } (coincidentally, her name is also the origin for the Margherita pizza). Around the same time, in 1890, the iconic [Mumbai dabbawala system](http://mumbaidabbawala.in/) was also set up to provide delivery logistics for home cooked food. While these are the origins of food delivery, the modern day form has evolved via 4 distinct steps.

The first phase of the modern food delivery era, is the one where you make a phone call to order your food. The origins of this can be traced back to Los Angeles in 1922, where a Chinese restaurant - [Kin Chu cafe](https://hungrco.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/rb03643-01.jpg?quality=85){: target="_blank" }  - provided the service until as late as 1am. The real boom in this sort of delivery happened after World War II where in the US and UK, returning soldiers from the war had developed a taste for Italian food and pizzas. This coincided with increasing prosperity and thus spending power, leading to perfect conditions for the delivery ecosystem to rise rapidly. It is around this time, in the 1950s, that the first example of free delivery emerged as well, with a pizza joint in Los Angeles offering [free delivery after a minimum order of $2.50](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2665098051_c9ca5dd56b.jpg){: target="_blank" }.

Ordering over the phone has been the dominant ordering and delivery type for most of the last century but as the internet emerged, so too did the advent of online food ordering. The first online delivery service showed up in 1995 in the form of World Wide Waiter which was essentially hosting menus online. The service was also among the first to feature the option for consumers to offer reviews, like [this one from 1995](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/restaurants/1995_Dec_29.EATOUT29.html){: target="_blank" } . While [pizza places were the earliest adopters](http://adage.com/article/digital/pizza-giants-customers-click-call-delivery/136087/){: target="_blank" }  of food delivery via online services, the 2000s saw increasing growth in this space with the launch of many players in the domain, including major services like Grubhub in 2004 and the foundation for Delivery Hero in 2008. These platforms saw huge growth over time, with Delivery Hero in particular, growing rapidly via a series of acquisitions of local platforms in different regions around the world.

Throughout this time though, the restaurants that were present on these platforms, had their own delivery infrastructure in place and these platforms simply acted as a convenient connection to the consumer. This proved to be a barrier for restaurants that didn’t already have these delivery logistics but wanted to jump on the rapid growth that delivery offers. The identification of this opportunity led to the creation of the next phase of food delivery - where the delivery platform also acted as the logistics partner. Deliveroo was launched in 2013 and Foodora a year later and both of these are now the trend setters in the market. The arrival of these platforms enabled many restaurants to jump on board the delivery growth curve as a way of [overcoming stagnating numbers in consumers who were dining in](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/restaurants/sd-fi-restaurants-delivery-20180411-story.html){: target="_blank" } , especially in more premium restaurants that hadn’t previously provided delivery. Around the same time frame, [online delivery slowly overtook phone delivery](https://qz.com/452609/online-food-delivery-ordering-is-about-to-overtake-phone-ordering-in-the-us/){: target="_blank" }  as well.

You can read more about the history of this domain in these articles (that we referred to as well) on [Time Magazine](http://time.com/4291197/take-out-delivery-food-history/){: target="_blank" }  and [The Skinny’s article in collaboration with Deliveroo](http://www.theskinny.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/delivery-history-deliveroo){: target="_blank" } . It’s now 2018 and since their launch, delivery partner platforms like Deliveroo and Foodora have been hard at work trying to capture more of the market. It is clear from our research that they are already the biggest movers in this space the likes of [Deliveroo reportedly growing at 25% a month](https://www.forbes.com/sites/freddiedawson/2016/02/26/delivering-25-month-on-month-growth-the-deliveroo-success-story/#bffc5426cada){: target="_blank" } . It’s these delivery companies who are increasing their influence by expanding into other areas of the domain as well and as a first step, both [Foodora](https://shop.foodora.com/) and [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo-packaging.com/){: target="_blank" }  are actively conducting experiments to sell packaging directly to customers via their own portals.

This is causing an interesting blend in the roles within our ecosystem as shown in the image below. The influence of the delivery platform is growing, and doing so rapidly.

In addition, Deliveroo, has leveraged its vast range of user data to understand that there are many cases where there is a demand for certain kind of food from consumers in a certain area, but no way for the customer to reach these consumers. For the customer, setting up a new restaurant space within reach of these areas requires significant investment and they take on a lot of risk. Deliveroo is eliminating that with [their Editions concept](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/28/deliveroo-dark-kitchens-pop-up-feeding-the-city-london){: target="_blank" }  which offers d[elivery optimized kitchen spaces](http://www.businessinsider.com/deliveroo-editions-pop-up-restaurants-roobox-2017-4?r=UK&IR=T&IR=T){: target="_blank" }  hosted within a cluster of containers. Each container hosts the chefs from one restaurant and the kitchen space is co-designed with the restaurateurs to ensure the most efficient and best possible home dining experience. This provides Deliveroo with the opportunity to capture even more of the revenue in the ecosystem, as shown in the image below.

### Why Are These Delivery Platforms Selling Packaging?

One of the key questions that emerged when uncovering what’s happening in Food Delivery 4.0 was - why have these delivery platforms decided to sell packaging? Our extensive research combined with our interaction with people working for delivery platforms meant that we were already armed with the key pieces of information to answer this.

> The reasons boil down to two aspects - securing their market position and increasing their growth.

The success of a delivery platform is directly dependent on the consumer base that it can build in order to capitalize on the growth enabled by indirect network effects - a phenomenon that’s well described in in the paper "[Bridging differing perspectives on technological platforms: Toward an integrative framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000456){: target="_blank" } " by Annabelle Gawer written in 2014. From the consumer’s perspective, when ordering food, no matter the restaurant, the quality of the delivery process is the responsibility of the delivery platform and if packaging fails, the platform is the first to be blamed.

Because of this, these delivery platforms are working with customers to help them understand the value of packaging to improve consumer experience and thus the demand. Since they operate as partners to the customers, they have great insight into how the customers operate and it was clear that the current process to acquire packaging is not easy for them. Customers who procure their own packaging are currently required to contact individual wholesalers, compare features, compare prices, lead time and even consider if small quantities can be shipped. Foodora and Deliveroo realized that they need to make it as convenient as possible for restaurants to access quality packaging.

### How Did They Enter This Space?

After we understand why, the next obvious question is to understand how delivery platforms managed become players in this space when there’s already so many existing wholesalers?

Once again, our extensive research proved useful. We found that existing wholesalers are at a disadvantage in this situations because they operate with a standard set of packaging types, shapes and sizes that customers have to choose from. The burden of research is on the customer and navigating through the plethora of wholesalers and their vast range of offerings is a cumbersome process for a customer to find out what is best for their use. In addition, during our case study of the Webstaurant Store, we found several disadvantages.

* It’s not easy to find suitable delivery packaging when vendors are offering so many options

* Even if they provide buying guides, the guides are focused on the technicalities and not on the customer’s use cases

* The packaging on wholesaler sites is very diverse and there are too many options for the same thing as shown in the below image. Based on research, this usually means the customer is less likely to buy something (see the famous [Jam experiment by Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper](https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20(2000).pdf){: target="_blank" }  for an explanation about why this is so).

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/Webstaurant-Store.png)

In contrast to existing wholesalers, Foodora and Deliveroo have a huge advantage. Since they’re positioned as partner platforms, customers are already used to working with them for cost efficient and hassle free logistics solutions. Getting packaging from them, that too with fast, free delivery, at reasonable prices and in small quantities makes it a very convenient one stop shop for customers. The partnership benefits the customer as well given that these platforms understand the users and can relay what they really want. Foodora takes this a step further as they [employ ex chefs as account managers](https://dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/food-delivery-disruptors-are-eating-up-the-market-how-is-foodora-handling-competition.html){: target="_blank" }  so that they can really relate to customers and in some cases, as a company they even [work with the customer to help](https://shop.foodora.com/pages/best-practice){: target="_blank" }  execute their vision. IF that’s not enough, [Deliveroo is not looking to make a profit](https://deliveroopackaging.be/){: target="_blank" }  on packaging and uses any profits that come in from their packaging sales to further improve the pricing for customers and even offer a price match option.

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/Deliveroo-Quality.png)

The other aspect that acts as a huge advantage is how both Foodora and Deliveroo do extensive testing around appearance, heat retention, sturdiness and eco-friendliness before selecting a product to be on their store. Combining this testing knowledge with their endless amounts of consumer feedback allows them to identify the packaging that truly works best, not just in general, but even for specific cuisines and food types (and showcase it on their website this way). In addition, [Deliveroo even claims](https://deliveroo-packaging.com/pages/faqs){: target="_blank" }  that they verify suppliers "We visit and inspect the manufacturing facilities and supply chain of all factories from which we source products. For pulp based products, we only use products sourced from sustainable forests". With all these factors, for customers, this eliminates any effort that is needed from their end to use quality packaging and thus, indirectly helps improve the consumer experience via better packaging.

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/Deliveroo-Types.png)

The extensive information provided on a Deliveroo product page is more than sufficient to make a decision about the packaging. It isn’t scattered like it would be on a traditional wholesaler’s site and the way the ratings and the explanations are provided, it is very simple to read without ever getting into overly technical information. This convenience combined with fast delivery makes it clear how these delivery platforms have managed to enter into this packaging space.

### What about these container restaurants?

The other curious development in the last year has been Deliveroo’s experiment with opening up delivery focused restaurants in containers,[ their Editions concept](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/28/deliveroo-dark-kitchens-pop-up-feeding-the-city-london){: target="_blank" } . As of January 2018, [Deliveroo had setup over 100 such restaurants across 12 cities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-15/deliveroo-takes-a-kitchen-sink-approach-to-food-apps){: target="_blank" } . Once again, our research and some additional secondary sources were able to help us understand what the situation was for restaurants that made this a lucrative opportunity for Deliveroo.

* Restaurant kitchens aren’t getting bigger but with delivery enabled, the demand is growing to the point where it is almost double in some cases.

* Restaurants would love to expand their businesses to areas of high demand but that would require expensive real estate investment that has a risk of

    * misjudging the demand

    * not finding the optimal location to cater for the delivery demand

* More premium restaurants want to offer delivery, but don’t want delivery agents crowding their restaurant space. During our restaurant tour, we actually observed how one of these restaurants had setup a separate window and pickup space for delivery agents.

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/Separate-delivery.jpg){: .image--max }

Deliveroo leveraged their extensive order data to understand patterns in user demand and used this evidence of demand to convince a wide range of restaurants to setup in their container based premises. This approach was so effective that it even convinced a Michelin Star restaurant to open a container based, delivery focused offshoot of their restaurant. The owner of the restaurant said this to Bloomberg - "Deliveroo used data to show high demand and an audience with disposable income".

A fascinating variety of restaurants have opted for this concept, ranging from Cocotte, a premium French restaurant originally based in Notting Hill to the likes of Motu Indian Cuisine, the offshoot of the previously mentioned Michelin Star Restaurant. The experiment has been a tremendous success for Deliveroo as they have made plans to [expand their Editions concept to a global level](https://london.eater.com/2017/9/27/16372708/deliveroo-rapid-growth-dark-kitchens-after-284m-investment-restaurant-delivery){: target="_blank" }  - with launches expected in Hong Kong, France, Netherlands, Dubai, Singapore and Australia this year. To go hand in hand with their global expansion, as of March 2018, they are also setting up the ["Pop Up" initiative](https://london.eater.com/2018/3/13/17113274/deliveroo-editions-start-up-incubator-new-pop-ups){: target="_blank" } which acts as a 12 week incubator for up and coming restaurant and food concepts in their Editions spaces.
