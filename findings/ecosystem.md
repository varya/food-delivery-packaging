After our extensive research of the domain, our team pieced together the ecosystem based on our understanding of each individual player and their perspectives on the rest of the domain. The overall structure, the connections and the flow of materials, money and influence was all done via multiple rounds of ideation.

After this process, we finally determined that the overall ecosystem around food delivery can be depicted with the below diagram that best describes the players in the ecosystem and how they’re all interconnected. The graphic has been designed in such a way that, depending on the focus and specific businesses, we can represent this map with different layers of information including material flow of packaging, flow of money and key influencers & decision makers in the domain.

This visual representation made it possible to describe businesses of both large and small market players with the focus on how they operate in the packaging domain. Using the map as a framework, Huhtamaki can analyze businesses existing in the market and figure out what they can offer. For example, the below two images indicate the material flow in the ecosystem (our default consideration) and the flow of money (in green) in the ecosystem respectively.

### Customer & Consumer

This division of definitions emerged at the very beginning of this project based on our discussions with Huhtamaki. It was important to get these fixed in place as it had the potential to add to confusion between them.

The consumer is the average person who is ordering and consuming the food, regardless of where the food was sourced from. They are the main source of spending power in the ecosystem. They are moderately influential as their packaging preferences get considered via complaints and bad experiences and delivery platforms want to ensure the best possible experience for them as a way of retaining their base.

The customer is the one producing the final cooked food output, so essentially restaurants of all shapes and sizes. Whether they’re Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) or premium restaurants at the heart of the city or everything in between, they’re both still customers for the company that’s selling the packaging.

Based on our analysis of the ecosystem, we believe customers are the most influential when it comes to decision making in the ecosystem. The reason for that is that packaging wholesalers both try to cater their products and services to be more attractive to them. This is true for delivery platforms as well, as their evolution of services is entirely centered around offering greater benefit to customers and increasing their dependency on the platform. In addition, delivery platforms have been clear that in order to offer good packaging and a better user experience for the consumer, they have to put in the most effort to convince the customers to adopt the packaging, thus making clear, who holds the greatest influence. It is important to note that, with the current ongoing experiments by Foodora and Deliveroo to sell packaging as well as offer delivery optimized restaurant spaces, it is likely that there is a power shift in the ecosystem towards the delivery platforms.

### Suppliers

In this domain, suppliers are the ones providing raw ingredients or processed food materials to the customers and the stores/cafes. This can be something as simple as a farm or wholesale grocer who provides ingredients like vegetables and fruits. This can also be something more complex like a food processor or central kitchen, who take the raw ingredients and provide it in a form the restaurants can transform into dishes more easily. This can include processed meat, chopped vegetables, pre-made sauce bases and bread. In the case of cafes, the central kitchens often provide the finished product such as packed sandwiches and baked goods and these are just sold off the shelf directly.

### Cafes & Stores

These include cafes with food readily available off the shelf such as Pret in London or Picnic in Helsinki. These also include grocery stores, like K-Market, and cafes that offer salad, soup and other similar food for take out, either pre-made or self made.

### Delivery Platforms

After extensive secondary research was further supplemented by information from our interviews in Berlin with employees from Foodora and Delivery Hero, we came to the conclusion that there are two distinctly recognizable forms of business models. These are the delivery marketplace platform and the delivery partner platform.

* A platform to connect consumers with restaurants that have their own delivery logistics
* Provide ordering and delivery platform
* Acquired many local platforms
* Charge a commision of 8-12%
* This is 80-90% of Delivery Hero’s overall  business

<td markdown="1">
##### Partner Model 
{: .model__subheader }

* Evolution of the marketplace where it is a platform and also a partner for delivery logistics
* Includes more premium restaurants that don’t want to deal with delivery logistics
* Delivery agents are employees
* Charge a commission of 30-35%

#### Marketplace Platform

The marketplace platform is one where the website simply acts as a conduit between food consumers with food producers who offer delivery in their area. For consumers, the marketplace acts as a one stop location to find all listed restaurants whose radius they fall under and enables ease of access, discovery of previously unknown restaurants and most importantly, convenience. The food producers in this case are those who have created their own infrastructure and logistics for delivery and can specify a delivery radius in line with their current capability. 

This has been the kind of business model that has been around for a while in the online ordering age, with the American service, Waiter.com, having been established as far back as 1995. Simply by virtue of age, this is the more dominant model in the market that covers 80-90% of the market for Delivery Hero and its many subsidiaries around the world that follow this model, shown in the image below.

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/delivery-hero.jpg){: .image--max }

In this model, the platform charges restaurants a commission of around 8 to 12% of the total sale value. The primary responsibility of the platform here is to collect orders and payment from the consumer and transfer them to the producer. The platform also often acts as the conduit for customer support for issues like order delays, damaged packaging, poor quality food and more.

#### Partner Platform

The delivery partner platform is one where the website isn’t just a marketplace but it also provides the logistics and resources (human and infrastructure) to enable delivery. This is the primary model for Deliveroo and Foodora who have their own delivery infrastructure which includes delivery agents and bicycles to enable faster urban deliveries. From our understanding of the market, this is the evolution of the marketplace platform that comes from recognizing that delivery logistics aren’t convenient for restaurants who try to do it on their own. They have to consider transportation costs, maintenance costs, salaries for delivery personnel and a bottleneck for how much delivery they can feasibly do with a limited number of delivery personnel. The delivery partner eliminates all this hassle by taking charge of the ordering and delivery logistics completely, thus allowing food producers to focus on their area of expertise. 

The other advantage of the partner platform is how it enables restaurants that haven’t traditionally offered delivery services before, to step into this system and [boost their overall sales by upto 30% according to Deliveroo Australia](https://internetretailing.com.au/delivery-apps-are-driving-restaurant-sales/). Deliveroo and Foodora take this a step further in how they target more premium restaurants that have not had a history of delivery offerings either, thus providing greater quality and a more exclusive set of food provider options compared to the competition. Compared to the marketplace model, the fees for this model are higher, with restaurants agreeing to a platform commission of around 30-35% where the amount is lower if the restaurant can assure exclusivity to the platform.

What makes this model especially effective is how it solves the fundamental issue of a marketplace model - the threat of key suppliers recognizing the success of the platform and breaking away to create their own independently. This dynamic is described well in the paper "[Bridging differing perspectives on technological platforms: Toward an integrative framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314000456){: target="blank" }" by Annabelle Gawer written in 2014.  An interesting parallel to this would be how Disney, after years of partnership with Netflix, is now on the verge of breaking away to [start their own digital media platform](https://qz.com/1156596/disneys-deal-to-buy-fox-is-all-about-netflix/){: target="blank" }, this putting Netflix’s position under threat. By offering delivery logistics and allowing restaurants to focus on just food production, the delivery partner platform can virtually “lock in” restaurants as they have little incentive to move out of such a convenient position. This ability to lock-in and reduce the incentive to move out and start on their own has led to increasing popularity, revenues and profits, and as a consequence leads to the explosion in valuation, such as Deliveroo being [valued at over $2 billion](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/24/deliveroo-valuation-hits-2bn-after-food-delivery-firm-raises-new-funds){: target="blank" } as of September 2017.

### Packaging Companies

As the examples in the image suggest, these are manufacturers and packaging converters like Huhtamaki who produce a range of packaging solutions for the sake of food delivery. Some prominent players who are already doing packaging that’s commonly used for food delivery include Sabert and Duni and their packaging is used in the Deliveroo & Foodora stores extensively.

### Packaging Wholesalers

They consolidate packaging of various types from across different manufacturers and sell it in bulk to customers.

### Delivery Agents

If we were to define it, this would be the person or company handling delivery logistics. In this ecosystem, there are three key types of delivery agents.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Restaurant Employee

This has been the traditional way of doing it for a long time and it is why the marketplace type of delivery platform has been around for so long - restaurants have their own delivery person (or multiple) and all the infrastructure required to enable delivery - vehicle, packaging, insulated container, disposable cutlery and more. 

#### Partner Platform Employee

Employee of the partner style delivery platform to provide delivery services. In the case of Foodora and Deliveroo, these are paid employees who work a full work day but with flexible schedules to ensure that there’s sufficient capacity to deliver during peak hours of lunch and dinner. These delivery agents are often given a uniform and during their work shifts, a branded, insulated delivery bag that they pick up from the nearest logistics center for the delivery platform. While Deliveroo allows these delivery agents to bring their own bike for delivery, Foodora also offers bikes of their own.

#### Third Party Delivery Logistics Provider

This is a new trend that’s emerging that was observed during our conferences in London, especially Post & Parcel. These are independent companies that are focused on optimized delivery logistics that isn’t just limited to food delivery. They realize that the demand for delivery of food only exists at peak hours around lunch or dinner time and so make their operations more efficient and their customer facing offerings more attractive by providing other services as well. These include collection of laundry, delivery of paperwork, package collection and other similar errands.
