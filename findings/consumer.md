Our extensive consumer research proved to be extremely fruitful as it provided us with a clear picture of exactly what consumers were looking for from packaging and food delivery services. As a recap, we conducted our ethnographic research at individual households in Finland, China and India. This provided an effective deep dive into consumer behavior along the entire journey of their food delivery process from making the decision to order, all the way to disposal of waste after consumption. Our team documented every step of the process via photos and video that we then reviewed later to collect our insights. The best part of doing this deep dive was how it provided us with an unbiased view from the consumer’s perspective without being influenced by any preconceived notions we might have had. Reviewing the videos and photos later also revealed some insights around things that were left unsaid but were useful to know.

The information from this ethnographic research was supplemented with consumer interviews which were done with 69 participants across 30 countries.

It is important to note that, as per the norms of ethical research, we’re protecting the privacy of our consumers and their face and any personal information will not be revealed. Only some images are provided here and these have been selected such that they convey the information without infringing in the privacy of the consumers in any way. In addition, the findings listed here are only the most significant ones. The full data set of both quantitative and qualitative findings are available on request.

### Many Elements of the Delivery Process are Universal

We found most elements of the consumer needs to be the same regardless of the delivery market being a mature one or one from a region that was developing. There was no difference in ordering patterns or packaging needs even across the various age groups that we tested.

#### Ordering Process is Standardized

Whether it is Wolt in Finland or Zomato in India or Meituan in China or Deliveroo in the UK - the process of ordering food via an app has become standardized globally. The steps shown in the Meituan app below are universal - select restaurant, select dishes, pay and track.

#### Rigid Plastic Containers are Popular Everywhere

We observed the use of similar rigid plastic containers for food delivery purposes in India, China, UK and Finland. Consumers also confirmed their use in other regions during our interviews as well.

#### Ordering is Driven by Convenience and Speed

Consumers choose where to order from based on how convenient the process is and how fast they can get their food.

We had many consumers mention that they would pay extra for faster delivery.

#### Secondary & Tertiary Packaging

Food arrives in a heat proof bag to the door, or the heat bag is left in the delivery vehicle. These tertiary bags are in a range of shapes and sizes.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="pack-levels"></div>

Food packaging are delivered in a paper or plastic bag. This secondary packaging allows the delivery agent to carry the contents easily and sometimes also has restaurant specific branding on them. 

*Can this bag be eliminated through packaging design?*

#### Leftovers & Waste

Leftovers are usually not discarded (when consumed in home environment) but it depends on how much food is left over. If there’s sufficient food, people are most likely to store leftovers in the original packaging for consuming at a later time.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="leftovers"></div>

In situations where packaging isn’t recycled or the leftover food isn’t enough to be saved for a second meal, everything is often discarded in the same bag and packaging that it arrives in.

#### Recycling is a Mixed Bag

Packaging is recycled if, after consumption of food, the packaging isn’t messy and it is easy to separate the materials. Mixed materials in packaging leads to more complex waste disposal and this makes consumers less inclined to recycle.

*Is there a way to enable material separation by design? How else can we simplify this?*

Recycling is very limited by regional regulations though. Some areas require very specific steps to be followed such as cleaning and separating while others have no such regulation and everything is thrown away together.

#### Aesthetic and Ethnic Experiences Matter

Transferring food to a separate dish leads to a loss of the original aesthetic. In addition, the visual aesthetic adds to the overall experience of consumption of the food. Attractive showcasing of food and a "quality feel" of the packaging even influenced and improved perceptions around the quality of food & the provider.

*This aesthetic aspect of on-the-go food is rarely taken into account. How can we do it?*

The ethnic aspect of food like sushi is lost in delivery. In one case, the consumer ended up adding a bamboo mat to recreate the Japanese spirit. From this it’s clear that the experience of eating delivery food is often drastically different to the restaurant experience*. *

*How can we align these experiences and add more of the ethnic aspect?*

### One Key Difference - Ordering Patterns - Collective vs Individual

There was a clear correlation between a country’s [Hofstede cultural dimension](https://geerthofstede.com/culture-geert-hofstede-gert-jan-hofstede/6d-model-of-national-culture/) on individualism and the ordering patterns that we observed. Participants from countries that had a higher rating on individualism were more likely to order one portion of food per individual while those that were more collectivist would be more likely to order food with the intent of sharing among the group. 

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="collective-individual"></div>

This was confirmed even in our ethnographic research as we saw these patterns reflected in how the ordering behavior of those in Finland was in contrast to those in India and China. Our key takeaway from this is that 

ordering patterns are *highly culture dependent and should be taken into account when creating packaging for different regions*

### Most Consumers Face Similar Packaging Issues

Our research across the regions revealed that, not only are there a wide range of packaging issues that are faced, but these are echoed across different regions as well. What was startling was how people actively avoid certain dishes because packaging is incapable of handling these effectively during the delivery process. For example, people actively avoid food like noodles, salads because they lose freshness & crispiness and also avoid soups because of leaks & spills. 

#### Condensation Ruins Freshness

Beyond basic quality concerns, the issue that most people voiced was around moisture and the amount of condensation in the packaging, especially with hot food, and how it adversely affected the food quality. The build up of moisture was particularly significant as a cause for people being unhappy with the state of fried and fresh foods during the delivery process.

#### Leaks and Spills are Common

After condensation, one of the frequent complaints we got was related to leaks and spills. This wasn’t always due to the failure in packaging either.

#### Temperature Isn’t Maintained

Whether it required food to be kept sufficiently warm or cold, the process was usually at the bare minimum level of satisfaction (at best) with the exception of wool insulated cold packs for meal kits.

<div class="inner-gallery text-center" data-gallery="wool-insulation"></div>

Several respondents didn’t directly mention about food not being warm, but when asked about what would be their ideal packaging feature, it was the most common response that came up.

### Most Consumers Want Similar Features

It’s not just the issues that are common worldwide, but the desired features are as well. 

#### Organized Packaging and Built-in Dividers

Many consumers expressed positive experiences with packaging when the packaging featured distinct dividers that keep different components of food separate. In similar fashion, when the packaging was in a form that allowed the food to be organized neatly, that was desirable too.

#### Eco-Friendly Packaging

Even if recycling was a mixed bag, several consumers actively expressed a desire for more eco-friendly packaging.

  </p>
</div>

### Extra Fees Evoke Mixed Reactions

One of the sections of our research looked to understand the feelings consumers have around the delivery fee that is charged. It was evident from our findings that most people were used to this phenomenon with nearly two - thirds of them saying they were ok with the delivery fee. There was an even split in terms of cost preferences around the fees, with people on average ok with an amount around $3.

![](../../assets/pictures/findings/delivery-fee.png){: .image--max }

We then explored whether people would be willing to pay extra for better packaging and while some said that they would, the majority said they’d not be willing to do so and we heard multiple disgruntled responses around how quality packaging needs to be included by default.
