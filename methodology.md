We were told that the project needed a designers mindset and that internally, they were still in the infancy of recognizing that there is a need. This meant that we needed to understand the ecosystem, not just as an overall picture, but also the perspectives of key players in it. To do so, we followed the process below.

Before we dive into the methodology, it is important to clearly define two terms that will be consistently referred to for the rest of the report. “Customer” in the context of this project refers to the customers of the packaging manufacturer, i.e. restaurants. “Consumer” is the person who orders and consumes the food.

## Secondary Research

Secondary research involves the use of existing resources to formulate an understanding of the topic we’re studying as well as regional trends in the domain. These resources could include research reports and statistical studies done by others who have done extensive work in the domain. For example a site like [Food On Demand News](http://foodondemandnews.com/experts-predict-huge-growth-for-on-demand-delivery-services/){: target="_blank" }
is a well known source of information in the domain and helped us gain a better initial understanding of what we were getting into. In addition, since the project was intended to be future focused, we also did a lot of digging into future trends and forecasts about the food delivery domain as well.

Secondary research also came into play when working on the solutions, particularly those focused on the consumer in the form of benchmarking which helped us understand other solutions that had been attempted and what worked as well as what didn’t. Surprisingly, secondary sources also helped enhance our understanding of delivery agents due to the large number of videos on Youtube that we found, documenting the whole process.

## Consumer Research

To understand the consumer experience in the food delivery space, we conducted extensive consumer research. The key goal was that we needed to understand the unmet needs of consumers as this would provide opportunities to innovate in ways that can meet these needs. We first conducted **ethnographic field research** where each team member went to a household situation and recorded video clips and photographs of the consumer behavior at various stages of the process.

This helped us get a first hand view of the food delivery process, their behavior and potential issues that they encountered. The videos helped us identify situations where there were mismatches between what people say they do and what they actually did. To supplement our ethnographic observations and add to the richness of our consumer insights, we did further consumer interviews (a mix of in person and video chat) with 69 people from across 30 countries about their food delivery experiences and packaging preferences. This gave us a great overall idea of consumer expectations and their key criteria for good packaging.

## Industry Research

While understanding the consumers was straightforward, it was a bit more tricky to find resources that would give us a clearer picture of the rest of the players in industry that our secondary research had revealed. To get a full 360 degree range of insights, we went with a multi-pronged approach that ensured we got to understand the domain from multiple perspectives.

We identified conferences and seminars that we could attend and went to London for the [Post&Parcel Live - Food Delivery Conference](http://www.postandparcel.live/events/post-parcel-live-2018-the-food-delivery-seminar/event-summary-c6c4c18eb04f4ae79827b074e5491772.aspx){: target="_blank" } (Jan 25th 2018) and the [Food to Go Conference - Food Study Tour](https://www.foodtogoconference.co.uk/){: target="_blank" } (Feb 8th 2018). Both of these helped us understand the perspectives into packaging and delivery from delivery providers, food producers (restaurants) and restaurant employees. The food study tour in particular took us to a variety of restaurants, from fast food to healthy eating to chain restaurants and even more unique eateries.

We then had meetings with individuals from delivery companies to get their perspective of these delivery platforms and understand how the domain is evolving for them. We also visited Huhtamaki’s production facilities to understand their capabilities and get the views of manufacturing experts and what their understanding of the domain was. We expanded our understanding of regional differences by having a session with Huhtamaki’s India Office as well. Lastly, we contacted Sense n Insight to round off the overall picture of the ecosystem.

## Overall Process

Overall, we followed an iterative co-creation process where Huhtamaki was provided with a view into both our raw data and extracted insights at every stage. Besides increasing the quality of our insights, this process gave us a lot of context about Huhtamaki, their needs, business and production capabilities. In turn, this context, combined with our deep understanding of the ecosystem helped us come up with solutions that best matched their desire to become an integral player in it.
