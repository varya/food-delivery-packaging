While we had a great picture of the consumer perspective, we knew from our secondary research that the ecosystem has a range of players whom we needed to understand more deeply. To do this, we looked at a variety of avenues to see how we could best gather this information. In the end, we opted to employ a wide range of them to get a 360 degree perspective of the domain from many of the most significant players who operate within it.

### Conferences and Seminars

We did a lot of research to locate potential conferences that we could attend that would give us a quick way of interacting with a range of players within the domain. We considered packaging conferences such as [Empack](http://www.easyfairs.com/empack-nordrhein-westfalen-2018/empack-nordrhein-westfalen-2018/){: target="_blank" } in Dortmund, Germany and [Food Pack Asia](http://www.foodpackthailand.com/en/){: target="_blank" } in Thailand. We also considered food related tech conferences such as [Anuga Food Tec](http://www.anugafoodtec.com/aft/index-4.php{: target="_blank" }) in Cologne, Germany and the [Euro Global Food Summit](https://food.global-summit.com/europe/){: target="_blank" } in Berlin.

Eventually we narrowed down our search based on location, cost of attendance and how well it fit our intended project schedule. This meant that the two that fit our requirements the best were The [Post&Parcel Live - Food Delivery Conference](http://www.postandparcel.live/events/post-parcel-live-2018-the-food-delivery-seminar/event-summary-c6c4c18eb04f4ae79827b074e5491772.aspx){: target="_blank" } in London (Jan 25th 2018) and the [Food to Go Conference - Food Study Tour](https://www.foodtogoconference.co.uk/){: target="_blank" }, which was also in London (Feb 8th 2018). Both of these helped us understand the perspectives into packaging and delivery from delivery providers, food producers (restaurants) and restaurant employees.

If the budget and schedule had permitted, we would have relished the opportunity to go for the [Food on Demand Conference](http://foodondemandnews.com/conference/){: target="_blank" } in Dallas, USA in March as it is the one the only conferences dedicated to mobile food orders and third party delivery. The other conference that would have proved useful would be [Home Delivery World](https://www.terrapinn.com/conference/home-delivery-world/index.stm){: target="_blank" } in Atlanta, USA in April, which covers the entire process of home delivery (but not limited to food) from warehousing, all the way to the end user’s door. We’d recommend attending these conferences if there is a need for further information about the domain, particularly from the perspective of the Americas. 

### Delivery Companies

We then leveraged our personal networks to locate and set up meetings with individuals from Foodora and Delivery Hero to get the perspective of these delivery platforms and understand how the domain is evolving for them.

The perspective of the delivery companies was important because in the current market trajectory, they possessed the maximum information from consumers and were the most prominent bridge with customers. Any information we got from them would help us validate our own findings directly from either of these groups while also better understanding the nuances of the relationship between them. 

### Other Industry Research

We consulted Huhtamaki’s India office to understand more about their perspectives on the Indian market and who was driving it to see if there was a contrast with more mature markets. To round off our ecosystem image, we visited one of the Huhtamaki production facilities to understand the capabilities. In addition, we spoke to experts about packaging at Package Testing & Research (PTR) who test packaging in terms of in store visibility, packaging design and the product qualities. PTR also conducts packaging usability research. At the visit we attended an eye tracking demo research.
