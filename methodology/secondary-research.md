We started with extensive secondary research to understand the domain. This included **research reports** like “[The Changing Market for Food Delivery](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-changing-market-for-food-delivery){: target="_blank" }” by McKinsey, and Morgan Stanley’s research on “[The Pizza Paradigm for Online Food Delivery](http://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/pizza-paradigm-for-online-food-delivery){: target="_blank" }”. It also included **statistical studies** of the domain on sites like Statista and also the data provided from Euromonitor by Huhtamaki. We also did an extensive analysis into expert trend forecasts from the domain, such as Raconteur’s “[The Future of Food & Beverage](https://www.raconteur.net/future-of-food-and-beverage){: target="_blank" }” and articles from well known sources in the domain like
[QSR Magazine](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/exclusives/9-fast-food-trends-2018){: target="_blank" },
[Food On Demand News](http://foodondemandnews.com/experts-predict-huge-growth-for-on-demand-delivery-services/){: target="_blank" },
[Packaging News UK](https://www.packagingnews.co.uk/features/first-service-uk-foodies-supplier-analysis-foodservice-12-10-2017){: target="_blank" }
and even articles from
[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3064075/hold-the-storefront-how-delivery-only-ghost-restaurants-are-changing-take-out){: target="_blank" }. This helped us understand the current state of the industry and the trends that we might need to be aware of going forward.

Since our initial scope was based on creating packaging solutions, we also did secondary research to do a sort of **solution benchmarking**, which gave us an idea of what was out there, what has been tried before and if possible, what didn’t work and why. This brought us to dozens of examples like [Zizzi’s modular packaging concepts](https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/13-19-november-2017/zizzi-reimagines-the-social-night-in-with-modular-takeaway-packaging/){: target="_blank" } or [Wagamama’s award winning custom designed take out experience](http://designawards.core77.com/Packaging/49540/Wagamama-Takeout-Experience){: target="_blank" } or even something as simple as [Burger-Fi’s tamper proof burger packaging](http://foodondemandnews.com/burgerfi-develops-tamper-proof-delivery-packaging/){: target="_blank" }.

As we delved deeper into the domain, we also came across a treasure trove of information on **regional trends** in major markets like UK, India, Singapore and China as well as detailed studies on the major players in the food delivery space, the likes of Deliveroo and Delivery Hero. We also did some research into the kind of eco-friendly **materials** that could be used, and during the course of this research we discovered that Huhtamaki already has an excellent in house solution capabilities with their expertise in [molded fiber based packaging](http://www.huhtamaki.com/web/moldedfiber){: target="_blank" }. We also looked at the secondary and tertiary packaging, the insulated kind, that are used for delivery.

Overall, the secondary research process was something that continued throughout the course of the project as it was a source of useful and frequently updated insights into the latest in the domain. It also helped us uncover future trends that experts could foresee both in the food delivery domain and from other spaces that could impact this domain. This was what enabled us to discover the success and potential expansion of [Deliveroo’s Editions concept](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-15/deliveroo-takes-a-kitchen-sink-approach-to-food-apps){: target="_blank" } which will be discussed later as well. Our full list of references can be provided on request.

### Video Journeys

One interesting aspect of the secondary research came up via the plethora of videos available on Youtube from the perspective of the delivery agents. Our team was pleasantly surprised to find that a lot of delivery agents, particularly for Deliveroo and Foodora, seemed to use helmet mounted cameras (as they used bikes) or GoPro’s to capture the entire process of what it takes for them to do their job. This was often accompanied by insightful commentary on their activities, what they do, what issues they face and how they try to overcome it. In the consumer research section, we discuss more about the ethnographic research process and its benefits, and in this case, these videos served as a treasure trove of research insights into the delivery agent’s needs and concerns in the food delivery process.
