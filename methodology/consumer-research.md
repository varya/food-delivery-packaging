To understand the consumer experience in the food delivery space, we need to find ways to exercise our sense of empathy. For this project, empathy is defined as 

> "the ability to step into the shoes of another person, aiming to understand their feelings and perspectives, and to use that understanding to guide our actions". 

This is important because it helps us understand the unmet needs of consumers and provides opportunities to innovate in ways that can meet these needs (source: Lecture on Design Research Methods by Niina Nurmi).

To accomplish this we first conducted **ethnographic field research** where we recorded consumers in their natural environments in a manner as described in "Studying What People Do" (source: from the book: Ylirisku, S. & Buur, J. 2007. [Designing with video. Focusing the user-centered design process](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846289606){: target="_blank" }. London, Springer. (pp 35 - 78)). Each team member went to a household situation and recorded video clips and photographs of the consumer behavior at various stages of the process and then reviewed these inputs later as well. 

By observing consumers as they ordered and consumed a food delivery meal, we got a first hand view of the food delivery process, their behavior and potential issues that they encountered. The videos helped us identify situations where there were mismatches between what people said they did and what they actually did, and it helped us see if there were things that are taken for granted that donâ€™t normally come up in discussions. This research was done in very different environments and in differing situations - ranging from a family ordering a shared meal in India or a couple ordering individual dishes in Finland.

To supplement our ethnographic observations and add to the richness of our consumer insights, we did further **consumer interviews** with 69 people from across 30 countries about their food delivery experiences and packaging preferences. This research was done in the form of 1 on 1 interviews, conducted either in person or virtually via Skype.

The interview first sought to understand more about their most recent delivery experience and then followed by their experience with delivery in general as well. We also looked into what they would define as their ideal packaging and their preferences around paying extra for it. Lastly, for some consumers, they also used meal kit services - a service where ingredients and a recipe are sent to you on a regular basis - and we were able to get them to compare and contrast with regular food delivery. Overall, this research approach gave us a great idea of consumer expectations and their key criteria for good packaging. You can find this information in our [Consumer Findings](../../findings/consumer/) section. In addition, a sample of the questionnaire that we used is available on request.
